# Facial-Expression-Detector

This project uses OpenCV and Keras to create a facial expression detector.

A Convolutional Neural Network was created using the Keras framework to train the dataset to classify the user's expression into one of seven categories: Angry, Sad, Happy, Neutral, Disgusted, Fear and Surprise and a pre-trained Haar classifier was used to train the model.
